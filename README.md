The other configurations are:

-   DRM
-   Wayland
-   SDL

Any of these buffering strategies can be used with multiple threads to render the frames.

## Getting started

### Hardware setup

This [document](https://dev.ti.com/tirex/content/tirex-product-tree/am62px-devtools/docs/am62px_skevm_quick_start_guide.html) from TI provides detailed information for the hardware setup

-   Connect to the board the following:

    -   UART
    -   Power
    -   Screen (HDMI)
    -   Ethernet (Connect the board to the same LAN the host is, the board obtains an IP address from the network manager)

- SD card is needed to flash the image.

  -   Follow the [guide](https://dev.ti.com/tirex/content/tirex-product-tree/am62px-devtools/docs/am62px_skevm_quick_start_guide.html) to download a pre-built `.wic` image

  -   Follow this [guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/processor-sdk-linux-rt/esd/AM62PX/09_01_00_08/exports/docs/linux/Overview_Building_the_SDK.html) to build the image with Yocto. 
      -   A tutorial to get lvgl recipe setup on Yocto is provided in [LVGL official documentation - Yocto](https://docs.lvgl.io/master/details/integration/os/yocto/lvgl_recipe.html)

-   If there are problems encountered flashing the SD card with BalenaEtcher as mentioned in the documentation, use this command instead:

    ```bash
    # Mount the SD on your system and find where it was mounter (e.g.: sda, sdb)
    sudo dd if=path/to/am62p-image.wic of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress conv=fsync
    ```

-   Insert the SD card in the slot and power up the board. The ti-app launcher should display an UI on the screen.

### Software setup

This guide was tested on Ubuntu 22.04 host.

#### Install docker

-   Follow this [tutorial](/https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-22-04) to install and setup docker on your system.

-   Support to run arm64 docker containers on the host:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install qemu-user-static
    docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static --reset -p yes
    ```

#### Install utilities

```bash
sudo apt install picocom nmap
```

### Run the default project

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/lvgl/lv_port_texas_sk-am62p-lp.git
```

**IMPORTANT**: 

- default application from lv_port_linux runs the widget demo. To run the benchmark demo, modify `lv_port_linux/main.c` : 
  ```c
  /*Create a Demo*/
  // lv_demo_widgets();
  // lv_demo_widgets_start_slideshow();
  lv_demo_benchmark();
  ```

- The default lv_conf.h might not be the best configuration for the board. Feel free to replace the default lv_conf.h with one of the provided configurations in `lv_conf_example` folder.
  ```bash
  cp lv_conf_example/lv_conf_fb_4_threads.h lv_port_linux/lv_conf.h
  ```

Build the docker image and the lvgl benchmark application:

```bash
cd lv_port_texas_sk-am62p-lp
./scripts/docker_setup.sh --create-image
./scripts/docker_setup.sh --build-app
```

Run the executable on the target:

-   Get the IP of the target board:

    -   <u>Option 1</u>: from the UART, on the board:

        ```bash
        sudo picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyUSB0
        ## Then inside the console, log as "root", no password required
        ## Then retrieve the ip of the board
        ip a
        ```

    -   <u>Option 2</u>: Get the IP from your host with nmap

        ```bash
        ## Find the IP of the board. You need to know your ip (ifconfig or ip a)
        ## HOST_IP should be built like this :
        ## If the ip is 192.168.1.86, in the following command HOST_IP = 192.168.1.0/24
        nmap -sn <HOST_IP>/24 | grep am62pxx
        ```

-   Then transfer the executable on the board:

    ```bash
    scp lv_port_linux/bin/lvglsim root@<BOARD_IP>:/root
    ```

-   Start the application

    ```bash
    ssh root@<BOARD_IP>
    
    ## stop default presentation screen if it is running
    systemctl stop ti-apps-launcher
    ######################################
    ## WARNING: do not stop these services if using wayland demo
    systemctl stop weston.socket
    systemctl stop weston.service
    ######################################
    
    export LV_LINUX_FBDEV_DEVICE=/dev/fb1
    
    ./lvglsim
    ```

### Change configuration

Some configurations are provided in the folder `lvgl_conf_example` .

The default configuration used is lv_conf_fb_4_threads.h. To change the configuration, modify the `lv_port_linux/lv_conf.h` file with the desired configuration.

### Start with your own application

The folder `lv_port_linux` is an example of an application using LVGL.

LVGL is integrated as a submodule in the folder. To change the version of the library:

```bash
cd lv_port_linux/lvgl
git checkout <branch_name_or_commit_hash>
```

The file `main.c` is the default application provided and is configured to run the widget demo provided by LVGL library.

The main steps to create your own application are:

-   Modify `main.c`
-   Add any folders and files to extend the functionalities
-   Update `Dockerfile` to add any package
-   Modify `CMakeLists.txt` provided file to ensure all the required files are compiled and linked
-   Use the docker scripts provided to build the application for Arm64 architecture.

## TroubleShooting

### Output folder permissions

If there is any problem with the output folder generated permissions, modify the permissions:

```bash
sudo chown -R $(whoami):$(whoami) lv_port_linux/bin
```

### Fbdev example runtime error

This error can be printed when running the application:

```bash
[Warn]	(1382.767, +37)	 lv_display_refr_timer: No draw buffer lv_refr.c:374
[Warn]	(1382.804, +37)	 lv_display_refr_timer: No draw buffer lv_refr.c:374
[Warn]	(1382.841, +37)	 lv_display_refr_timer: No draw buffer lv_refr.c:374
[Warn]	(1382.878, +37)	 lv_display_refr_timer: No draw buffer lv_refr.c:374
```

To fix the issue find the existing fbdev available:

```bash
ls /dev/fb*
```

Export the variable to match the fbdev name:

```bash
export LV_LINUX_FBDEV_DEVICE=/dev/fb0
```

### Wayland example runtime error

While running the application, if there is an error about `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, add the following environment variable on the board.

```bash
export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/1000
```

### Changing configuration causes errors building the application

CMake may have troubles with CMakeLists.txt changes with some variables setup. If there is any problem building, try to clean the build folder:

```bash
rm -rf lv_port_linux/build-arm64
```
